# **Concepts**

The House is tasked with accepting deposits from the accounts and faciliatates them to act as a house
for a specific market for a small amount of fees. A portion of these fees will be consumed to cover
the transaction costs associated with posting/resolving markets.

The account can withdraw the deposited tokens at any point of time. The tokens that has been
used to accept bets for the house, along with the unused tokens if not withdrawn, will be settled at the
resolution of the market.
